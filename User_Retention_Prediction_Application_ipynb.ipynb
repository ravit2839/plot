        "* Problem Statement:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * For application developers, a potential challenge for them would be the user retention. They need a realiable and reuseable method to simluate the retention rates of their users so that they can figure out which group of users are likely to be retained/churned. In this way, they can later on keep different users interested in their product by performing corresponidng retention task.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Abstract:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Create a cloud hosted BigQuery machine learning model to determine the likelihood rates of users continue to use the app based on the user behaverior logs and user demographic information.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Pre-process the training data using user's demographic and behavioural logs. \n",
        "  * Train and evaluate machine learing models using BigQuery ML in GCP.\n",
        "  * Make predictions using the terminative ML model.\n",
        "  * Create project dashboard and perform visualization of the prediction results.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Technology Stack:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Python, Bigquery(SQL), GCP\n",
        "\n",
        "* Dataset:\n",
        "  * In this application, we will be using a public dataset provided by GCP: an event based dataset which is generated by a real-world gaming mobile app called 'Flood-it!' that contains 5700000 event log infos from more than 15175 users.\n",
        "  * Dataset format: Google Analytics 4 property data and the Google Analytics for Firebase data that is exported to BigQuery Export schema\n",
        "  * Dataset URL: https://developers.google.com/analytics/bigquery/app-gaming-demo-dataset\n",
        "  * Flood-it! App URL: https://flood-it.app/ \n",
        "\n",
        "* Persona:\n",
        "  * Mobile Game developers who need to know the user retention rate and coresspoinding analytic data regarding their aplication. Knowing all these data would be significantly useful for them to form better targetd and customized user retention task on user in different retention categories.\n"
